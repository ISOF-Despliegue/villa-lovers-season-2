# Postman Integration Tests (Identity + Catalog)

## Files

- `StreamButed-Identity-Catalog.postman_collection.json`
- `StreamButed.local.postman_environment.json`

## What this collection covers

1. Health checks for both services.
2. Identity auth lifecycle: register, login, refresh, promote.
3. Cross-service communication: `identity-service` promotion event consumed by `catalog-service`.
4. Catalog protected CRUD flow with JWT from Identity.
5. Negative cases (auth failures and unauthorized catalog writes).

## Run in Postman UI

1. Import both JSON files.
2. Select environment: `StreamButed Local`.
3. Run the full collection in order.

## Run with Newman (CLI)

From repo root:

```powershell
npm install -g newman
newman run tests/postman/StreamButed-Identity-Catalog.postman_collection.json -e tests/postman/StreamButed.local.postman_environment.json
```

## Notes

- The test suite includes a polling mechanism when checking if a promoted user is replicated to the catalog service. Since the replication happens asynchronously via RabbitMQ, the test retries up to 5 times (with 500ms delays) to account for network and processing latency.
